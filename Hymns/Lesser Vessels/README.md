### The Lesser 'Hymns'
These are the newer 'hymns', contemporary christian music, etc. that I deem to be lesser than the old hymns. The only reason I did these was either because they just came randomly while I was fiddling with the instruments, or because I had to do these because the music team at our church needed it done.

I don't think these ones hold a candle to the reverent, deeply-sincere, heart-felt and pure music that are the old hymns, written by men of God, not because they wanted a new single for their new 'Christian album', but just because they wanted to express their feelings about their walk with the LORD. Those are the prayers inside the closet. These are the prayers in midst of the town square.  

### *"Now how can you say such a thing? Who gave you the right to judge one hymn to be better than the other?"*
People like you are the reason why 'Christian Movies' will keep on sucking, and 'Christian Music' will keep on being the shallow bull-crap that it is, and the reason why any and every random crap with the word "Hallelujah" and the promiscuously liberal use of the Name of our LORD, is deemed as edifying-enough to be sung by the congregation during holy service.

Listen, I want to be edified at a service -- to be reminded of the things to come, to have the fire in my heart re-kindled a bit so that I can manage to keep on walking a bit more, to be reminded not to give up but to persevere in being a good and faithful servant. And I have a very strong opinion that the liturgy should be taken seriously.  There are some of us who feel like dying and are going to service in hopes of hearing something that will get us through another week, and all we get to hear is bull-crap that ends up making us feel even more miserable.

Christians and Criticisms don't seem to be mutually non-exclusive anymore. Whatever happened to the fact that almost every epistle written by the Apostles can basically be summed up as "*get your shit together, brethren*"? And Our LORD's admonishment of the seven churches in the Book of Revelations?

Any half-sober analysis of the lyrical/melodic content, the background, the socio-cultural/historical context, the inspiration, etc. of the olden hymns will lead to the conclusion that I have reached: **not all hymns are created equal**.
