# Arranged By Others; Transcribed By Me

This directory (and it's subdirectories) contains music arranged by others but transcribed by me.

## License:
While my transcriptions are CC-BY, since these arrangements are made by others, it might be complicated. But since I found these arrangements for free on the internet, hosted by the arrangers themselves (for the most part) - often with a message along the lines of "enjoy this free content", I treat all the arrangements as if they're licensed under a CC-BY license to begin with. The attribution can be found in the transcribed files - often as comments in the .ly files, a 'property' in .tg files (should I add some in the future), etc.

### Naming Scheme:
```composer_arranger_piece-name_instrument.file-extension```
